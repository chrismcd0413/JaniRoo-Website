# Purpose
During my time at JMCleanCo, we ran into a problem of a patchwork of 3rd-party software platforms that never really solved all the problems the way we needed. As a result, I set out to address our unique needs. Our team was distributed around 15 cities in 7 different states that we were trying to manage remotely. This project helped centralize our cleaner management and give us a clearer picture of our day-to-day operations.
